# Heartmade - Paweł Jurewicz
> Product-Driven Web Design for Founders & Holistic Business Mentoring

## Overview
Heartmade is a unique consultancy founded by Paweł Jurewicz that bridges the gap between **Product Management**, **AI-Assisted Web Design**, and **Holistic Mentoring**. The core mission is to help founders, freelancers, and specialists launch their first digital businesses by removing technical chaos and internal blocks.

## Core Methodology: "Product-Driven Web Design"
Unlike traditional web design, Paweł's approach starts with **Product Strategy**:
- **Discovery & Strategy:** Defining the Unique Value Proposition (UVP) and MVP scope.
- **Agile & Lean:** Applying 20+ years of IT experience to build scalable, high-conversion products.
- **AI-Enhanced Velocity:** Building production-ready websites and integrations (calendars, newsletters, payments) in record time (3-hour strategic sessions).

## The "Heartmade" Difference (Holistic Approach)
Paweł Jurewicz integrates his background as a **Professional Thai Masseur and Bodyworker** into his business practice:
- **Tension vs. Flow:** He identifies "tension blocks" in business models and user journeys, similar to bodywork, to create seamless "flow" for users and founders.
- **Mentoring:** Focuses on overcoming Impostor Syndrome, procrastination, and internal resistance.
- **Expertise:** 20+ years in IT (Product Owner/Manager) combined with 6+ years of holistic bodywork.

## Services & Pricing
- **Free Discovery:** 15-minute consultation to check "chemistry".
- **Launch Package (2900 PLN):** 3h strategic session + AI-built website + integrations (Calendar/Newsletter) + 1h post-launch support.
