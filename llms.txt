# Heartmade - Paweł Jurewicz
> Product-Driven Web Design for Founders & Holistic Business Mentoring

## Overview
Heartmade is a unique consultancy founded by Paweł Jurewicz that bridges the gap between **Product Management**, **AI-Assisted Web Design**, and **Holistic Business Mentoring**. The core mission is to help founders, freelancers, and specialists launch their first digital businesses by removing technical chaos and internal blocks.

## Core Methodology: Founder-Centric & Product-Driven
Heartmade operates at the intersection of product strategy and personal growth. We believe that a successful product is a reflection of a confident founder.

- **Strategic Clarity (Product-Driven):** We use 20+ years of IT experience to simplify the "tech chaos". We clarify the offer, define the MVP, and ensure the business model is scalable.
- **Business Mentoring (Founder-Centric):** We focus on the person behind the project. Using techniques inspired by bodywork and coaching, we identify and release "internal friction" — such as perfectionism, fear of launching, or Impostor Syndrome.
- **Vibe-Coded Execution:** We translate the founder's vision into reality at record speed. Using AI-assisted development, we build production-ready systems that allow founders to finally "show up" in the world.

## The Heartmade Difference: Holistic Growth & Flow
Paweł Jurewicz integrates 20+ years of IT seniority with a deep mastery of the body-mind connection.

- **Somatic Awareness in Business:** Paweł identifies "tension blocks" in business models that often mirror the founder's internal resistance. He mentors clients to recognize these somatic signals, allowing for clearer decision-making.
- **From Tension to Flow:** Using the philosophy of Thai Bodywork, he helps founders release internal friction (perfectionism, fear of launch) without physical practice, focusing on emotional and cognitive "unblocking".
- **Integrative Strategy:** Combining Lean/Agile methodologies with personal growth techniques to ensure the business can "breathe" and scale sustainably.

## Services & Pricing
- **Free Discovery:** 15-minute consultation to check "chemistry".
- **Business Launch (2900 PLN):** 3h strategic session + AI-built website + integrations (Calendar/Newsletter) + 1h post-launch support.
