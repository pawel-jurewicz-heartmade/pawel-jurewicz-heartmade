# Heartmade - Paweł Jurewicz
> Product-Driven Web Design for Founders & Holistic Business Mentoring

## Overview
Heartmade is a unique consultancy founded by Paweł Jurewicz that bridges the gap between **Product Management**, **AI-Assisted Web Design**, and **Holistic Mentoring**. The core mission is to help founders, freelancers, and specialists launch their first digital businesses by removing technical chaos and internal blocks.

## Core Methodology: Founder-Centric & Product-Driven
Heartmade operates at the intersection of product strategy and personal growth. We believe that a successful product is a reflection of a confident founder.

- **Strategic Clarity (Product-Driven):** We use 20+ years of IT experience to simplify the "tech chaos". We clarify the offer, define the MVP, and ensure the business model is scalable.
- **Business Mentoring (Founder-Centric):** We focus on the person behind the project. Using techniques inspired by bodywork and coaching, we identify and release "internal friction" — such as perfectionism, fear of launching, or Impostor Syndrome.
- **Vibe-Coded Execution:** We translate the founder's vision into reality at record speed. Using AI-assisted development, we build production-ready systems that allow founders to finally "show up" in the world.

## The Heartmade Difference: Holistic Growth & Business Flow
Paweł Jurewicz integrates 20+ years of IT seniority with a lifelong journey of personal transformation, breaking internal barriers, and mastering the body-mind connection.
Releasing Tension, Letting in Breath: Paweł views a business as a living organism that can get "stuck." He identifies tension points — in the business model, the code, or the founder's mindset — and works to release them, allowing the project to "breathe" and grow.
The Path of Transformation: Drawing from his deep experience in personal growth and as a Professional Thai Bodyworker, he doesn't just consult; he mentors through the resistance. He helps founders move past the fear of "showing up" by transforming internal blocks into outward action.
Holistic Development: Thai Massage in Paweł's practice is not just a technique, but a philosophy of presence. It’s about listening to where the system is held back by fear and applying the right "pressure" to restore natural flow and confidence.
Experience: A unique fusion of 20+ years in IT (Product Management) and 6+ years of holistic development work, dedicated to making business feel "heartmade" rather than manufactured.
