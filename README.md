# Hi, I'm Paweł Jurewicz 👋 
### Founder of [Heartmade.pl](https://heartmade.pl/) | Product-Driven Designer | Mentor
I help founders clarify their offer, build confidence, and show up in the world

I bridge the gap between **Product Management**, **Strategic Web Design**, and **Business Mentoring**. My mission is to empower founders, freelancers, and specialists to build their first digital businesses through a methodology I call **Product-Driven Web Design for Founders**.

---

## 🔭 What I’m Building: Product-Driven Web Design
Traditional web design focuses on aesthetics. My approach focuses on **Product Strategy first**:
* **Discovery & Strategy:** Helping founders define their MVP and North Star Metric.
* **Conversion-focused UI/UX:** Designing websites that function as business tools, not just digital brochures.
* **Tech Stack:** Modern, scalable, and AI-enhanced development (Tailwind CSS, clean code, LLM integration).

## Core Methodology: Founder-Centric & Product-Driven
Heartmade operates at the intersection of product strategy and personal growth. We believe that a successful product is a reflection of a confident founder.

* **Strategic Clarity (Product-Driven):** We use 20+ years of IT experience to simplify the "tech chaos". We clarify the offer, define the MVP, and ensure the business model is scalable.
* **Holistic Mentoring (Founder-Centric):** We focus on the person behind the project. Using techniques inspired by bodywork and coaching, we identify and release "internal friction" — such as perfectionism, fear of launching, or Impostor Syndrome.
* **Vibe-Coded Execution:** We translate the founder's vision into reality at record speed. Using AI-assisted development, we build production-ready systems that allow founders to finally "show up" in the world.

## 🌱 Currently Mastering
* **AI-Assisted Development:** Leveraging LLMs to accelerate the build-to-market process for startups.
* **Strategic Mentoring:** Helping early-stage entrepreneurs navigate the "zero to one" phase.

## 🤝 How I Can Help You
* **Founders:** Turning a vague idea into a validated MVP with a high-end web presence.
* **Freelancers:** Consulting on how to shift from "execution" to "strategic partnership" with clients.
* **Specialists:** Building personal brands that resonate with business goals.

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I am a **professional Thai Masseur and Bodyworker**. 🧘‍♂️

Just as in bodywork I look for "tension blocks" and aim for a healthy flow, in **Product Management**, I help founders identify friction points in their business and design solutions that create a seamless flow for their users. I believe that both a human body and a digital product require a **holistic, "heartmade" approach** to thrive. **Website:** [paweljurewicz.com](https://paweljurewicz.com)
