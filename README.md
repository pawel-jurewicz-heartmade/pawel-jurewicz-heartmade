# Hi, I'm Paweł Jurewicz 👋 
### Product-Driven Designer & AI Assisted Web Developer | Business Mentor
**I help founders clarify their offer, build confidence, and show up in the world.**

I bridge the gap between **Product Management**, **Strategic Design**, and **Holistic Growth**. My mission is to empower founders, freelancers, and specialists to build their first digital businesses through a methodology I call **Product-Driven Web Design**.

---

## 🔭 What I’m Building: Product-Driven Web Design
Traditional web design focuses on aesthetics. My approach focuses on **Product Strategy first**:
* **Discovery & Strategy:** Helping founders define their MVP, UVP, and North Star Metric.
* **Conversion-focused UI/UX:** Designing websites that function as business tools, not just digital brochures.
* **Vibe-Coded Execution:** Translating human intent into production-ready code at record speed using AI, allowing us to focus on *what* we want to say, not *how* to code it.

## 🧠 Methodology: Founder-Centric & Holistic
Heartmade operates at the intersection of product strategy and personal transformation. We believe a successful product is a reflection of a confident founder.

* **Strategic Clarity:** Leveraging 20+ years of IT seniority to simplify "tech chaos" and build scalable business models.
* **Internal Flow:** Identifying and releasing "tension blocks" — such as perfectionism or Impostor Syndrome — that hold projects back.
* **Breath & Presence:** Just as in my work with the body, I help founders let in "breath" and space into their business, transforming fear into outward action.

## 🌱 Currently Mastering
* **AI-Assisted Development:** Mastering the art of vibe-coding to accelerate the build-to-market process.
* **Business Mentoring:** Deepening techniques that help entrepreneurs navigate the "zero to one" phase.

## 🤝 How I Can Help You
* **Founders:** Turning a vague idea into a validated MVP with a high-end web presence.
* **Freelancers:** Shifting from "execution" to "strategic partnership" with clients.
* **Specialists:** Building personal brands that resonate with business goals.

### ⚡ The Heartmade Difference
I am a **professional Thai Masseur, Bodyworker and Podcaster** 🧘‍♂️

In my world, there is no difference between a "stuck" muscle and a "stuck" business project. Both require a holistic approach to release tension and restore flow. I believe that both a human body and a digital product require a **"heartmade" approach** to truly thrive. Speaking your inner truth is our shared mission; only the means differ.
